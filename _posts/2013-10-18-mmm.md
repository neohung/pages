[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) started out as an idea, an ideal even. Before
its inception, there was a distinct lack of continuous integration systems
available for the open source community.

With GitHub on the rise as a collaboration platform for open source, what was
missing was a service to continuously test contributions and ensure that an open
source project is in a healthy state.

It started out in early 2011, and gained a bit of a follower-ship rather
quickly. By Summer 2011, we were doing 700 builds per day. All that was running
off a single build server. Travis CI integrated well with GitHub, which is to
this day still its main platform.

The architecture started out very simple. A web component was responsible for
making builds and projects visually accessible, but also accepting webhook
notifications from GitHub, whenever a new commit was made to one of the projects
using it.
